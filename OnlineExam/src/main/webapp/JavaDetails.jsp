			<h3>What is Java?</h3>
			<p>Java is a programming language and computing platform
				developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle). It was first released in
				1995 and has since become a cornerstone in the world of software
				development.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="highlight">
			<h3>Why do I need Java?</h3>
			<p>Java powers a significant portion of todayâ€™s digital world.
				Many applications and services rely on Java for its reliability,
				security, and cross-platform capabilities. It is used in everything
				from enterprise systems to mobile apps and web applications.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="highlight">
			<h3>Is Java free to download?</h3>
			<p>
				Yes, Java is free for personal use and development. You can download
				the Java Development Kit (JDK) from <a
					href="https://www.oracle.com/java">Oracle's Java website</a>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="highlight">
			<h3>Why upgrade to the latest Java patch?</h3>
			<p>Updating to the latest Java patch ensures that your Java
				applications run with improved performance, stability, and security.
				It is important to stay updated to protect against vulnerabilities.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="highlight">
			<h3>Technical Information</h3>
			<p>When you download Java software from java.com, you get the
				Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which includes the Java Virtual
				Machine (JVM) and core libraries needed to run Java applications.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="highlight">
			<h3>Java Plug-in software</h3>
			<p>The Java Plug-in software, part of the JRE, allows Java
				applications to launch from supported web browsers. It is integrated
				into the JRE and cannot be installed separately.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="highlight">
			<h3>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</h3>
			<p>The JVM is a crucial component of Java software responsible
				for executing Java bytecode. It is included in the JRE and ensures
				compatibility across different platforms.</p>
